            "question": "Are there any payments if the project is cancelled? ",
            "answer": "No, you’re free from charges on any cancellation request in case you need us to stop working on the job. You just need to inform us one month before the job. So, we are able to close all current work on your project. In case you need to close your project development urgently, you will need to pay for 2 working weeks more. That is made to ensure that we fully cover all our developers' team remuneration and bonuses for working on your project.",
